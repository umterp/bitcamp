2014,Brambles,Australia,"(-25.274398, 133.775136)",1,Timber,Yes,"Management is responsible for the development, implementation and management of systems that:
- identify, assess and manage risks in an effective and efficient manner;
- enable decisions to be based on a comprehensive view of the reward-to-risk balance;
- provide greater certainty of the delivery of objectives; and
- satisfy the Group’s corporate governance requirements.

One element of Brambles’ internal risk control systems is its Code of Conduct (attached).  Brambles is committed to working towards Zero Harm (Charter attached), meaning no injuries and no environmental damage and no detrimental impact on human rights. Brambles focus is to provide innovative, efficient and sustainable pooling solutions to its customers.

The Environmental Policy in the Code of Conduct is set by the Board and operates worldwide, including in countries that may not yet have enacted laws for the protection of the environment. CHEP maintains strict lumber sourcing policies that support the replenishment of natural resources by sourcing lumber in a responsible and sustainable manner. CHEP does not source from protected areas, parks or similar areas in which harvesting operations do not promote responsible forestry management. CHEP has a target of achieving chain of custody certification for lumber purchased for CHEP pallets by 2015, to provide a focus for the continual improvement and promotion of the responsible and sustainable procurement of lumber.

In addition, in FY13, Brambles developed a global supplier policy covering areas of compliance, diversity, labour standards, human rights, safety and the environment and outlining the Group's commitment to working with suppliers to develop more efficient, safer and sustainable supply chains.

Suppliers are expected to follow the principles of Brambles Zero Harm commitment. The supplier policy will be rolled out to all Brambles businesses in FY14.

Further information on Brambles' risks management processes and controls are reported in the Corporate Governance Statement of its Annual Report pp 26-28 attached.

In addition, when completing the demerger of its Recall business, Brambles disclosed key risks in the Scheme Book (attached below). This included Fluctuations in commodity prices and raw material availability (including lumber). (see p 106)",Non-material risk,"In Australia, The Illegal Logging Prohibition Amendment Regulation 2013 prohibits the importation and sale of all timber products containing illegally logged timber; prohibits the processing of illegally harvested domestically grown raw logs; requires importers of regulated timber products and processors of raw logs to comply with due diligence requirements; requires the accurate description of legally logged timber products for sale in Australia; establishes enforcement powers and offences, and imposes penalties; and provides for a review of the first five years of the operation of the Act. Similar legislation may exist in other countries in which CHEP operates. The risk associated with legality of purchased lumber means CHEP must be able to verify this within its supply chain, especially where pallets may be shipped internationally.",Material risk,"Our customers are increasingly concerned about impacts on the environment. Reputational risk could arise if we are not seen to be addressing our impacts on the environment. Brambles’ Group risk matrix, which sets out the top 10 “net” risks facing the Group and the steps being taken to mitigate those risks, in FY13 included risks of competition and retention of major customers (p 7 of Annual Report 2013). Reputational risk could arise if we are not seen to be addressing our impacts on the environment. If we are not sufficiently transparent about our actions in these areas, it could lead to customers taking their business to competitors. The credibility and business value of our business brand could be undermined by negative publicity around any practices that are counter to reducing our environmental impact. In 2010, Brambles announced its sustainability strategy and its strategic objectives and initiatives over five years to 2015. The targets Brambles has set for 2015, including the target of chain of custody certification for lumber purchased for pallets, are key drivers in its efforts. Commentary on the targets and the progress made is in the 2013 Sustainability Review, pp 12-14. Brambles could face reputational damage that affects its share price through exclusion from ethical/green investment funds, including superannuation funds in Australia that consider sustainability initiatives. Brambles’ Group risk matrix in FY13 included risks to our business model, strategy and execution, innovation and others (see p 7 of the Annual Report 2013).] Brambles believes its sustainability strategy and targets, including annual reporting on progress against these targets, address the environmental concerns of its investors. It regularly provides communication to the investment community to alleviate this risk and considers sustainability throughout its business operations, including through its Code of Conduct and Zero Harm Charter.",Material risk,"Brambles’ Group risk matrix, which sets out the top 10 “net” risks facing the Group and the steps being taken to mitigate those risks, in FY13 included risks to the business model, where changing supply chain dynamics and customer needs could render CHEP's existing service offering and business model out of date (p 7 of Annual Report 2013). Current market issues that, in combination or separately, could support competitive service offerings include attributes of wood versus alternative materials, etc. These issues could, over time, have an impact on revenue, cost base, economies of scale and the value of CHEP's existing assets.

The Scheme Book - demerger of Recall (attached) noted that rapid and sustained changes in the availability and price of lumber may result in decreased demand for Brambles' services, increases in its costs and reduced profitability (p 104). It also noted Brambles has operations directly or indirectly exposed to volatility in costs of lumber (p 106). While Brambles generally sources supplies of raw materials from a range of providers in each geographic region, in Australia Brambles is dependent on a single supplier for its lumber and plastic resin. CHEP's pallet pooling system operates on the principles of recover, reduce, reuse and recycle, reclaiming and reusing lumber when pallets are conditioned. This reduces the need for virgin raw materials (see p 14 Sustainability Review). Pallets Asia-Pacific (of which Australia is a part) reported $US391.8 million sales revenue for FY13. Pallets reported $US3,944.4 million in sales revenue for FY13."

Brambles risk management process includes risks in the purchasing of commodities.

One of the key elements of Brambles’ internal risk control systems is its Code of Conduct. In its Code of Conduct, Brambles specifies that Brambles is committed to working towards Zero Harm, meaning no injuries and no environmental damage. Our goal is to provide innovative, efficient and sustainable business solutions in support services to our customers.

The Environmental Policy in the Code of Conduct is set by the Board and operates worldwide, including in countries that may not yet have enacted laws for the protection of the environment. It includes Brambles intent to seek out suppliers who have a proactive approach to environmental risk management and who manage natural resources responsibly. This underpins CHEP's strict lumber sourcing policies. CHEP maintains strict lumber sourcing policies that support the
replenishment of natural resources by sourcing lumber in a responsible and sustainable manner. CHEP does not source from protected areas, parks or similar areas in which harvesting operations do not promote responsible forestry management. CHEP has a target of achieving chain of custody certification for lumber purchased for CHEP pallets by 2015, which will provide assurance of responsible and sustainable practices.

Brambles' sustainability strategy specifically addresses responsible management of forest resources for Brambles, its suppliers, customers and the wider community, attached below. Brambles engages with its suppliers to assess whether their practices are in line with Brambles' environmental principles and acts accordingly to help those suppliers meet Brambles’ requirements and standards.

The Zero Harm Charter and the Code of Conduct are both attached below.

Further information on Brambles' risks management processes and controls are reported in the Corporate Governance Statement of its Annual Report on pages 40-42, attached below.",Non-material risk,"In Australia, The Illegal Logging Prohibition Amendment Regulation 2013 prohibits the importation and sale of all timber products containing illegally logged timber; prohibits the processing of illegally harvested domestically grown raw logs; requires importers of regulated timber products and processors of raw logs to comply with due diligence requirements; requires the accurate description of legally logged timber products for sale in Australia; establishes enforcement powers and offences, and imposes penalties; and provides for a review of the first five years of the operation of the Act. 

Similar legislation may exist in other countries in which CHEP operates.

The risk associated with legality of purchased lumber means CHEP must be able to verify this within its supply chain, especially where pallets may be shipped internationally. For example, CHEP Asia appointed a procurement manager during the Year in Malaysia and made good progress in raising awareness of sustainable lumber sourcing within CHEP’s Malaysian lumber supply base. All Malaysian suppliers source 100% of CHEP lumber from state forests with government transit documentation to ensure all lumber is tracked, species-checked and verified that it was legally harvested.",Material risk,"Our customers are increasingly concerned about impacts on the environment.

Each Committee is responsible for ensuring that all risks associated with their specific area of the business are identified, analysed and managed systematically and appropriately. 
Senior management and risk owners, with the assistance of the risk management committees, periodically review the risks to ensure that the risk management processes and controls in their area are appropriate and effective, and that new risks are identified. Risk registers are used to document the risks identified, level of severity and probability, ownership and mitigation measures for each risk. The risk registers are reviewed by the risk management committees on at least a quarterly basis.The Board is ultimately responsible for this system of risk management and internal control. Risk management committees assist the executive directors in the operation and implementation of the risk management process, and provide a source of assurance to the Audit Committee.

Each prospective contract has to be signed off on sustainability criteria before the procurement team can execute or modify a contract.The Drax process for ensuring compliance with legal sustainability requirements as well as with corporate policy is founded on the provision of sufficient information for the assessment of risk associated with a supply contract. If a contract is, at any time during contract negotiation, deemed a ‘high risk’ then further detailed information is required before a contract can be signed.

Based on these impacts we have developed a sourcing strategy to address the environmental risk associated with our purchases of palm oil.  Since 2008 Kellogg has taken steps to source sustainably grown palm oil and to do our part to end the deforestation associated with palm oil cultivation. In fact, all of the palm oil we use today is 100 percent sustainably sourced through a combination of GreenPalm certificates, mass balance and segregated, sustainably grown supply. Also, 100 percent of the palm oil we use comes from suppliers who are members of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), a multi-stakeholder organization (of which Kellogg is also a member) working to ensure that palm oil production is economically viable, environmentally appropriate and socially beneficial.  
Specifically,  •In Europe, we began using a segregated supply of sustainably grown palm oil in the summer of 2012. By the end of 2013, we expect that at least 90 percent of the very small volume of palm oil we use in Europe in our products, aside from Pringles® , will be segregated sustainably grown. The palm oil we use in Pringles® in Europe is sourced through the mass balance system, which combines sustainably grown and conventional palm oil.  •In other markets where neither a segregated or mass balance supply are sufficient or feasible, we are continuing to help growers fund the transition to sustainably grown palm oil by purchasing GreenPalm certificates to cover 100 percent of our current palm oil use, as we have done since 2010.   
With the RSPO and other stakeholders, we continue to explore solutions to this global issue and to encourage our mass balance suppliers to increase their percentage of sustainable palm oil as the supply increases. We also require, through our Supplier Code of Conduct, our vendor partners to commit to reducing their impact on the environment.

With a loss of 5.2 million hectares of forest each year around the world the global supply chain scenario could result in a material risk for Kingfisher amounting to 30% global timber shortages possible by 2020 and 75% price rises, could result from global timber shortages by 2020.

Other risk assessment tools/mechanisms: Internal Audits. QA Approval processes. CR team Due Diligence. Operating Company level risk assessments. Product specific identification and action plans.
On timber, our assessment of risk is species and country of origin specific e.g. For products which contain hardwood species sourced from the tropics:
All Kingfisher Operating Companies will adopt the position where all products which contain hardwood species sourced from the tropics are ‘Certified, Well-managed or Recycled’.
All Kingfisher Operating Companies will request, and where available within equal business terms accept, either FSC certified sources with a full chain of custody, verifiable recycled material or timber sourced via a TFT project, Rainforest Alliance (SmartStep) participant or from a forest source working with WWF (GFTN). 

Over the past 2 years Kingfisher has developed an internal Quality Management Tool (QMT) for unified responses to quality and legislative risk. The tool includes a risk matrix, designed to respond to the requirements of the EU Timber Regulation and harmonise the evaluation of risk and actions to mitigate risk across the Group. The QMT also includes a traceability element and document filing system as part of the Groups wider due diligence.

Deforestation and growing global demand could result in shortages and price volatility. Taking a restorative approach is the best way to safeguard our future timber supplies at an affordable price. It is also important to protect biodiversity and to help mitigate the effects of climate change.

In order to plan product strategies it is imperative to understand where we will be getting our timber from in the next 5 - 10 years. Tropical hardwood timbers and other species are gradually becoming scarcer, the market response has focussed demand on the 8% of certified forest resources. It is our obligation to build a product offer that customers can rely on. The availability of timber products is, due to the increasing demand for sustainable options, perhaps one of the biggest supply chain challenges facing the retail sector and Kingfisher has designed a foreword thinking timber policy designed to guide the business towards strategic responses.

For these purposes, we have consistently pursued green procurement methods and made purchases prioritizing recycled and certified paper products. 
However, in assessing the risks toward the ecosystems of the food-producing communities from which we acquire biological resources, we have gained an increased awareness of global forest resource issues, and it has become clear that sustainability in the use of forest resources and conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity are also essential for us to continue operating as a company. 
With this in mind, in 2012 we conducted a preliminary survey of suppliers for container materials and copy paper. Our responses indicated that there were no major problems regarding raw materials used by our major suppliers; however, we also learned that the legality of some paper in circulation within Japan today cannot be confirmed.

Sri Lanka is one of the world's major tea exporting countries. Approximately 60% of tea leaves imported to Japan are from Sri Lanka, and approximately 25% of the tea leaves imported to Japan from Sri Lanka are used for Gogo-no-Kocha, the No.1 bottled tea brand produced by Kirin.
Under such a circumstance, the Kirin Group has conducted surveys on their supplier tea plantations in Sri Lanka concerning their sustainability and efforts to conserve the ecosystem.
First, we identify the plantations from which we procure black tea leaves, and evaluate their compliance with ecosystem conservation efforts, starting with the certifications they have acquired. 
The Group discovered that approximately 40% of its supplier plantations have acquired certification for contributing to biodiversity, and the proportion of those who have acquired the certification has gradually increased.

Kirin Group uses many paper packages to safely deliver products to customers, particularly in the integrated beverages business. Therefore, the Kirin Group has promoted green procurement and prioritized purchasing of recycled paper and eco-certified paper. However, with growing awareness for ecological risks in the source regions of biological materials used by our Group, it has become more apparent that preserving the ecological system including bio-diversity and sustainable use of forestry resources are imperative challenges for the sustainability of the Kirin Group. To address these challenges, we conducted a preliminary supply chain survey in 2012 for package materials and copy paper. The results demonstrated that there were no major problems related to the raw materials supplied by our dominant suppliers. On the other hand,as a result of risk analysis of the impact to ecosystem in the source regions of biological materials, it has become more apparent that global awareness to the issue of forest resources has increased and we also found that paper materials were distributed in the domestic market for which legal authenticity could not be verified.",Non-material risk,"At present, no domestic laws and regulations refer to the sustainability of paper packages applicable to business organizations.

In Australia, discussions are ongoing about regulatory controls for general package recycling. This trend could lead to reference to the sustainability of paper packages, while the probability is not very high.

With regard to palm oil, we comprehensively surveyed raw materials during the period from 2011 to 2012 to understand the status of palm oil procurement. As a result, we confirmed that the Kirin Group uses palm oil as a raw material, although the amount is insignificant. Because palm oil is often produced in plantations reclacing from tropical rain forests, many international food manufacturers that use raw materials obtained from non-sustainable sources are already exposed to reputational risk. There is also a risk to leading integrated beverages manufacturers such as us.

The Kirin Group manufactures and sells carbonate alcohol beverages with a beer-like taste in the Japanese market using soy as a raw material, and the Group is the top player in this sector (it is the only case in which soy is used as a raw material within our Group). With regard to soy, an issue related to the deforestation of rain forests in the Amazon Basin has been reported recently, because soybeans are often cultivated in resulting pastures. The Kirin Group could be exposed to reputational risk if it happens to purchase and use soybeans produced in such an area. In 2011, the Kirin Group investigated procurement source of soy and confirmed that it is in China. The Group also confirmed that there was no forest risk related to this procurement source. In this investigation, we confirmed that forest risk associated with soy existed mainly in Brazil. Therefore, we established a rule that our Procurement Division should consult the Environmental Management Division if any procurement of soy from Brazil is planned. While the United States is currently included as a procurement source, we also confirmed that procurement from the United States has no negative impact on forests.",Non-material risk,"At present, no domestic laws and regulations refer to the sustainability of soy.

Regular management reporting provides a balanced assessment of key risks and controls and is an important component of the Boards’ assurance. 

Our Sustainable Development Risk and Change Management Standard guides the ways in which sustainable development risks are identified and managed, while our sustainable development risk register is updated annually to ensure mitigation plans are in place for those risks with a high likelihood of occurrence and/or impact potential. Risks include both inherent operational risks as well as strategic risks. In addition to the key impacts on our business and our stakeholders, we identify sustainability trends and opportunities and seek to mitigate risks that affect our longer-term prospects and financial performance. Risk management is one of the internal processes that have informed the identification of our six material sustainability issues, and the commitments we have set to monitor and improve our performance within these.

We exercise due diligence prior to the introduction of new practices, processes and products. Our Sustainability Screening Tool has been developed to identify sustainability risks as part of business change, rather than on going management of assets or operation.

The major outcomes are reflected nowadays in the purchasing and operating principles and instructions of the company, but can be summarised as follows: 
1 Companies that were ready to commit to sustainability were a small minority of all the suppliers - a careful Due Diligence process had to be established to screen suitable partners 
2 Lacking traceability in the product chain - need to create a totally new way of palm oil trading. Traders and middle-men were passed by and contacts developed directly to the grower companies.
3 Obvious reputational risks were foreseen based on the campaigning that was ongoing - full support to RSPO to  promote sustainable practises
4 (regarding all the vegetable oils) a major risk of uncontrolled expansion of the cultivation, increasing deforestation risks - need to set strict sustainability requirements for the supply, with specific clauses in the agreements.
Direct physical risk: insignificant, as all suppliers comply with criteria, are traced back and monitored. Indirect risk is relevant, as Neste Oil is currently a major user of palm oil.
Regulatory risk: biofuel industry is applying the most stringent sustainability criteria that are not expected to be changed as such; the ILUC may provide uncertainty to general acceptance of palm oil based products.
Reputational risks are significant, as irresponsible expansion of palm oil cultivation may cause severe negative impacts - which are often linked to biofuels rather than the main uses, i.e. food and oleochemical industries.",Material risk,"The European RED directive mentioned earlier requires complete awareness on the origins of the raw materials in order to be eligible for biofuel status within the scope of the directive.  - The European ILUC discussion is, however, focusing very much on palm oil, and in particular its use for biofuel production. The final proposal will be released within weeks, and further handling in the European Parliament is expected to continue to the end of 2013.

The major outcomes are reflected currently in the purchasing and operating principles and instructions of the company, but can be summarised as follows: 
1 There was a need to ensure that companies in the supply chain are willing to disclose and commit to sustainability targets - a careful Due Diligence process had to be established to screen suitable partners and ensure transparency 
2 There was a need to build and ensure traceability in the supply  chain - need to create a totally new way of palm oil trading. Traders and middle-men were by-passed by and contacts developed directly to the growers of oil palms.
3 Obvious reputational risks were foreseen based on the campaigning that was ongoing - full support to RSPO, especially their grievance mechanism practices, to  promote sustainable practises
4 (regarding all the vegetable oils) a major risk of uncontrolled expansion of the cultivation, increasing deforestation risks - need to set strict sustainability requirements for the supply, with specific clauses in the agreements.

Procurement areas are relatively close to manufacturing facilities with identifiable sourcing.  All fibre can be traced back to its origin. We operate in a cyclical industry. Global economic conditions may cause substantial fluctuations in our results. Our products are significantly affected by cyclical changes in industry capacity and output levels as well as by the impact on
demand from changes in the world economy. Because of supply and demand imbalances in the industry, these markets historically have been cyclical, with volatile prices. In addition, recent turmoil in the world economy has led to sharp reductions in volume and pressure on prices in many of our markets. We took actions to improve efficiencies and reduce costs in all aspects of our business. We continue to benefit from a high level of economic pulp integration on a group-wide basis, which reduces the impact of pulp price fluctuations on our consolidated group results. We will continue to monitor the supply/demand balance, which might require us to impair operating assets and/or implement further capacity closures. The cost of complying with environmental, health and safety laws may be significant to our business. Our aim is to minimise our impact on the environment.

It involves considerable control efforts along the supply chain. The Global Supplier Standard is strengthening the company's ability to verify supplier performance. The goal of no controversial sources anywhere in the supply chain means, for example, that SCA does not currently purchase any wood pulp from Indonesia or other Asian countries. SCA requires pulp suppliers to demonstrate reliable systems and have documented procedures in place to enable control of the supply chain and traceability of the origin of wood raw materials. The company continues to perform assessment and supplier visits to ensure suppliers meet policy and expectations. All SCA's pulp suppliers are FSC Chain of Custody and/or PEFC Chain of Custody certified. The company's wood sourcing policy sets out a tiered approach to help suppliers achieve SCA's ultimate goal of sourcing fibre from forests independently certified as sustainably managed. The decisions by a number of pulp suppliers not previously involved in FSC to now offer FSC-certified products is seen as a positive result of the dialog between SCA and suppliers concerning sourcing policy and goals. Since the wood sourcing policy's introduction in 2004, the number of pulp suppliers has been reduced to approximately 20. Twelve pulp supplier sites were audited in 2012; another twelve will be audited in 2013. The new pulp supplier database provides mills with fast and easy access to key information about suppliers, including certification options, pulp specifications, ecolabel comparability, bleaching technology used, and so forth. The outcomes in 2012 in this area are: 1) All deliveries of pulp to SCA facilities met the Group target, 2) All of SCA's wood-consuming units are reviewed by independent auditors and meet the requirements of the Group target, 3) A new global fibre-sourcing group for the hygiene operations strengthened supply chain management, 4) The global supplier standard was implemented among pulp suppliers.",Material risk,"SCA manages several regulatory risks related to wood supply with a potential to impact pulp and pricing policy.

2014,SCA,Sweden,"(60.128161, 18.643501)",1,Timber,Yes,"The SCA Environmental Committee and SCA Public Affairs Fiber Network are responsible for the assessment of risks relating to sustainable forest management and its potential business and physical effects on SCA and its stakeholders. The Committee includes environmental managers from all business areas and the Senior Vice President Sustainability. The tools for identifying business risk including regulatory risk (e.g. impacts of EU Timber regulations, the US Lacey Act, Australian Timber Regulations), operational risk (e.g. securing supply of sustainable wood material) and reputational risk (e.g. reliance on certification) primarily comprise of getting continuous reporting from the business units and the annual strategy process, which includes risk management. Much time and resources are dedicated to interact both vertically and horizontally in the organisation so that risks associated with sourcing of wood based products are identified and escalated to the Group. Most operational risks are managed by SCA’s business units at a local level, but are coordinated centrally when necessary and to inform SCA’s overall business strategy.
 
SCA regularly carries out materiality analysis to understand what issues are most important and relevant to SCA to inform SCA’s strategy and operations. The 2013 analysis was based on a survey of 1,500 internal and external stakeholders in combination with SCA’s own assessment of the strategic importance of the areas. 

To mitigate the risks with sourcing of wood based products, SCA has a Group target to achieve and maintain zero fresh fiber-based material, including pulp, from controversial sources. This involves considerable control efforts along the supply chain. SCA requires pulp suppliers to demonstrate reliable systems and have documented procedures in place to enable control of the supply chain and traceability of the origin of wood raw materials. The company performs assessments and supplier visits to ensure suppliers meet the requirements in SCA’s Global Supplier Standard. Nine supplier mills were audited in 2013 and this work will continue in 2014. All SCA's pulp suppliers to mills and factories, with 100% SCA ownership, are FSC and/or PEFC Chain of Custody certified.",Material risk,"SCA manages several regulatory risks related to wood supply with a potential to impact pulp and pricing policy. Large changes in the FSC/PEFC criteria or in new timber regulations could affect the availability and access to certified timber, which would drastically reduce SCA’s supply. This would lead to SCA not fulfilling its own target to source from certified timber suppliers. It could also prevent SCA from delivering FSC/PEFC Chain of Custody certified products to its customers. This is seen as a material risk since this would negatively influence SCA’s sales and thereby profit.

SCA conducts regular comprehensive strategic reviews and monitors developments in global legislative developments related to: - Impact of certification schemes standard changes (i.e. Due Diligence systems; forestry management practices etc.) - Impact of new legislation (EU Timber regulations, the US Lacey Act, Australian Timber Regulation etc.) - Developing demands for environmental (Eco) labels (e.g. EU Eco-label, Nordic Swan, etc.) - Carbon neutrality of Biomass - Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) - Social issues (e.g. Indigenous population rights) -Longer term macro trends (population growth, land use change, land availability, climate change etc.).",Non-material risk,"SCA currently does not source from controversial sources. Although deforestation, in particular tropical forest deforestation is a major global issue to address, pulp, paper and packaging are not major contributors to deforestation. About 50% of wood raw materials used in SCA’s forest products operations are sourced from the Group’s forests. The remainder is sourced from suppliers, the majority of which are located in Sweden. SCA’s own forests have been certified according
to the FSC standard since 1999, and the PEFC standard since 2011.All suppliers of pulp to factories and mills, with 100% SCA ownership, are Chain of Custody (CoC) certified according to FSC and/or PEFC. SCA’s purchasing policy for wood raw materials includes a step-by-step process to support suppliers in their transition to third-party certification. The Group undergoes audits to verify compliance with both standards for both SCA’s own forests and for suppliers. Since SCA actively undertake activities to ensure full traceability in our supply chain and that no sourcing is made from controversial sources, we don’t see that this pose a material risk for our reputation.

SCA works with several groups including relevant industry associations (e.g. CEPI), the major certification bodies (SCA is a board member of FSC International), the World Business Council for Sustainable Development's Forest Solutions Group, and the consumer Goods Forum Pulp, Paper and Packaging group to support broader movements towards sustainable forest management practices. Promoting the use of forest products from sustainable sources can help counteract the economic and social forces driving deforestation by providing an alternative, sustainable land use.",Material risk,"Operational risks for SCA associated with producing timber are connected with SCA not meeting the criteria and demand from international certification organisations, such as FSC and PEFC. Should SCA lose its FSC certification for forest management, it would influence SCA’s availability of certified wood material since 50 % of the wood supply is from our own forest holdings. This is a material risk since it would lead to SCA not fulfilling its own target to source from certified timber suppliers. In addition, the demand of wood for fuel is increasing, which leads to higher competition of the wood resources globally.

Operational risks for SCA associated with buying pulp are due to failure of internal control processes and the human factor. This could influence SCA’s aces to certified pulp. SCA has systems and tools in place to reduce the risks of mistakes and facilitate continuous assessment. Another part of this work is to communicate clear organizational responsibility."

•	Geographical origin of the wood used for the production of cellulose and indication of the sub-national region of origin;
•	Indication of the percentage of wood associated with the geographical origin;
•	Indication of the type of wood used (common name and, where applicable, the scientific name);
•	Indication of the main steps in the logistics chain, from the origin of the timber to the stage of pulp and paper production;
•	Certificates of forest management and chain of custody forest owned by the manager of the forest resource and the producer of pulp;
•	Documents or other information indicating compliance of the harvested wood with the applicable legislation.
•	Human rights and working conditions;
•	Health and safety aspects;
•	Corporate ethics and corruption
•	CSR management
Once received back the questionnaire, Sofidel checks the correct fulfillment of the questions, performs the risk assessment for each raw material and arranges for the archiving both paper and electronic questionnaires. Electronic archiving is done on the database “josh archive” accessed via web.
The elements of assessment are the following:
•	Assurance of compliance with applicable legislation, which may include certification or other third-party- verified schemes which cover compliance with applicable legislation,
•	Prevalence of illegal harvesting of specific tree species,
•	Prevalence of illegal harvesting or practices in the country of harvest and/or sub-national region where the timber was harvested, including consideration of the prevalence of armed conflict,
•	Complexity of the supply chain of timber and timber products.

For the suppliers that do not answer to the questionnaire are forecast different steps of action, from the remainders to the cancellation from the list of the suppliers .

A sort of risk assessment is also carried out to evaluate the production of wood pulp at country level.

2014,"Sumitomo Forestry Co., Ltd.",Japan,"(36.204824, 138.252924)",1,Timber,Yes,"[Physical operational risks] 
Since its foundation, the Sumitomo Forestry Group has developed its business centered around timber. Timber is one of the blessings of biological diversity, and there is the risk of the Group’s business losing its foundation if this blessing is lost. The Sumitomo Forestry Group considers these to be important risks, and in response in 2007 the Group established the Timber Procurement Philosophy and Policy, the Timber Procurement Standards that stipulate matters such as evaluation standards for legality, and the Timber Procurement Action Plan that established concrete numerical targets as handles sustainable timber. In the Timber Procurement Action Plan targets have been set to increase the handling rate for timber certified by a third party organization (timber from certified forests) . The Group not only procures sustainable timber from other companies, it also conducts plantation forest operations on its own in areas around the world such as Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. 
[Regulatory risks]
As laws and regulations aimed at eliminating timber that has been logged illegally are being strengthened in countries around the world, if the Sumitomo Forestry Group is not capable of responding adequately to these laws and regulations as applicable, it could become exposed to risks including compliance risks and the risk of having to pay compensation for damages.  To ensure that it does not handle timber that has been logged illegally, the Sumitomo Forestry Group established the Timber Procurement Philosophy and Policy and the Timber Procurement Action Plan in 2007, and conducts legality verification on all overseas suppliers of timber that it imports directly from. The procedures of the Group’s legality verification initiatives are described in the [“Futher Information”]. 
[Reputational risks] 
・In the event of a supplier of the Sumitomo Forestry Group failing to comply with laws and regulations concerning logging, it could negatively affect Sumitomo Forestry and its impaired brand image may result in sales decrease in the timber distribution business. In order to avoid these risks, the Sumitomo Forestry Group conducts legality verification in accordance with the procedure described in [Regulatory risks].
・Information on timber procurement risk is exchanged with NGOs such as WWF Japan as called for.",Material risk,"The Sumitomo Forestry Group has developed its business centered around timber. For this reason, if the Group is not able to appropriately respond to regulations concerning illegal logging, it could become exposed to risks including compliance risks and the risk of having to pay compensation for damages, and accordingly regulatory risk is considered to be an important risk.   For example, the EU enforced the EU Timber Regulation (EUTR) in March 2013. A similar regulation (the Revised Lacey Act) has already come into effect in the US and regulations are also being developed in Australia. The objective of these regulations is to eliminate illegal logging that has an adverse impact on the economy, environment, and society and to eliminate unfair competition in order to increase the value of legal timber to ensure that timber and timber construction materials that have been managed appropriately are distributed in the market. The EUTR covers businesses (importers and suppliers) that import timber to the EU market (the 27 member countries) and the products covered by the regulations consist of nearly all timber and timber products that are sold in the EU. The regulations mainly obligate business to (1) take appropriate measure to ensure that timber that has been logged illegally and timber products from this illegal timber is not shipped, (2) to conduct due diligence to verify legality, and (3) to ensure traceability (having an understanding on the history information of timber handled).
 As a means of risk management for these issues, the Sumitomo Forestry Group established the Timber Procurement Philosophy and Policy and the Timber Procurement Action Plan in 2007, and conducts legality verification on all overseas suppliers of timber that it imports directly from. The Group’s legality verification procedures are described in the [“Futher  Information”]. Legality verification was completed in FY 2009 based on these procedures, and subsequently the Group has continued to implement these initiatives. In FY 2012 the Group formulated the Third Timber Procurement Action Plan that stipulates targets for FY 2013 to FY 2015. It stipulates that  legality checks shall be continued for not only directly imported timber, but all suppliers of timber and timber products handled by the Sumitomo Forestry Group.",Material risk,"In the event of a supplier of the Sumitomo Forestry Group failing to comply with laws and regulations concerning logging such as the EUTR, it could negatively affect Sumitomo Forestry and its brand image and as a result cause sales in the timber distribution business to decrease. Accordingly, the Group considers a reputational risk as an important risk. As stated in F10.1, laws and regulations aimed at eliminating timber that has been logged illegally are being strengthened in countries around the world, such as the EU Timber Regulation in the EU and the Revised Lacey Act in the US. In the event of a supplier of the Sumitomo Forestry Group failing to comply with laws and regulations concerning logging, it could negatively affect Sumitomo Forestry as a trading company that handles their products, impair its brand image and as a result cause sales in the timber distribution business to decrease. If the timber procurement conducted by the Sumitomo Forestry Group is viewed by an environmental NGO as not giving sufficient consideration to environmental issues or social issues such as occupational safety and health or human rights, this could lead to a negative campaign on a global level, which in turn could negatively affect its brand image and cause sales to decrease not only in the timber distribution business, but in the housing business as well. As a means of risk management for these issues, the Sumitomo Forestry Group established the Timber Procurement Philosophy and Policy and the Timber Procurement Action Plan in 2007, and conducts legality verification on all overseas suppliers of timber that it imports directly from. The Group’s legality verification procedures are described in the [“Futher Information”].Legality verification was completed for all suppliers of directly imported timber in FY 2009 based on these procedures, and subsequently the Group has continued to implement these initiatives.

It stipulates that  legality checks shall be continued for not only directly imported timber, but all suppliers of timber and timber products handled by the Sumitomo Forestry Group. Initiatives will be continued to clarify the traceability of all timber handled and further improve the accuracy of legality verification.",Material risk,"Since its foundation, the Sumitomo Forestry Group has developed its business centered around timber, and the volume of timber procured from forest by the Group is one of the highest levels among Japanese companies. The Group’s business could lose its foundation if timber is lost. Furthermore, even if there is a change in only the quality or volume of timber, it will be necessary to respond in some way, and this could be a major factor of costs increase. Therefore, business risks are considered to be an important risk. In preparation for possible future insufficiencies in raw materials, the Sumitomo Forestry Group not only procures sustainable timber from other companies, it also conducts plantation forest operations on its own in areas around the world such as Indonesia and Papua New Guinea."

Severe weather or other natural events capable of affecting the company's assets - standing timber and manufacturing facilities - have long been at the core of our risk management practices. We manage our timberlands for a variety of risks, including losses from storm blow-down, pest infestation, fire and drought. We locate our forestlands in geographies with manageable incidence rates of storms, drought and fire. We use regionally adapted sustainable forest management practices to reduce the effects of drought on regeneration, and we use thinning to reduce the potential effects of drought and insect attack. We also have one of the world's largest - if not the largest - traditional tree-breeding programs, through which one of our focuses has been to develop tree varieties that are able to withstand the regional extremes in climate that can occur over the multi-decade growth period for forests. We continue to build on over five decades of long-term growth and yield research to understand growth trends over time and their relationship to local and regional climate. This information forms a basis for adaptive management to address possible shifts in our growing environment. We invest in on-going monitoring of our forests to provide an early indication of change in adaptation and reforestation success. Our bio-mathematical models of tree growth in response to growing environment, climate and cultural practices enable assessment of possible vulnerabilities to shifts in climate that may affect our forests. We regularly update our forest timber inventories, growth projections, harvest schedules and planting activities to account for potential and actual annual losses from extreme weather. Logging and replanting schedules are also adjusted to account for weather-induced conditions that could delay either activity. In making these adjustments, we are able to draw on more than 100 years of silvicultural research and experience, as well as the most up-to-date statistical methods to quantify these risks by region."

Security of supply: We have assessed the availability and cost of required quantities of certified sustainable timber at present, as well as in the future. As well as the risk should our sourcing practices support unsustainable timber harvesting.

Environmental and social risks: This includes deforestation, biodiversity loss and species extinction, environmental degradation, illegal harvesting, land conflict and displacement, and social conditions. We have identified that we can make considerable impact in reducing these risks due to the volume of timber we source. 

Reputational risks: With increasing pressure from consumers, NGOs and activists on the issue of deforestation, we have identified that this is a risk to our business. Our commitment to sourcing certified sustainable and traceable timber helps reduce this risk.

- Level of consumption across business: We do not use a large level of soy in products themselves, but our risk assessment has determined that our largest use of soy take place in the supply chain, in animal feed (volume yet to be determined).

- Supply chain risk: We need to take into account the availability and cost of required quantities of soy. We know that South Africa is not a major importer of soy. We have large volumes of locally produced soy, where deforestation is not a risk.

- Impact on brand reputation: As a leading responsible retailer, we do not want to let down our customers by being seen to ignore this important environmental issue.

2014,Woolworths Holdings Ltd,South Africa,"(-30.559482, 22.937506)",2,Palm Oil,Yes,"Our risk assessment process evaluates the following:

Operational risks: We have assessed the level of consumption across the business and identified that Woolworths is not a major user of palm oil. As palm oil has unique qualities that meet safety, health, taste, shelf-life and rancidity requirements, however, suppliers find it difficult to substitute palm oil and therefore we are reliant on having a secure supply of palm oil.

Security of supply: The current difficulty we face in securing physical supply of the limited amount of certified sustainable and traceable palm oil available globally is a risk to our business. We have also identified that continuing to support unsustainable palm oil production and environmental degradation, poses threat to long term security of supply. For now, we will have identified the value of purchasing GreenPalm certificates to help the RSPO incentivise more sustainable production and therefore mitigate these risks, until we are able to physically source certified sustainable palm oil. 

Environmental and social risks: This includes deforestation, biodiversity loss and species extinction, environmental degradation, land conflict and displacement, and social conditions. Whilst we are not major users of palm oil, we have identified that we can make considerable impact in mitigating these risks by using certified sustainable palm oil in our products, particularly because of the pressure it will put on other larger users of palm oil in South Africa.

Reputational risks: With increasing pressure from consumers, NGOs and activists on the issue of deforestation, we have identified that this is a risk to our reputation. Our purchase of GreenPalm Certificates and commitment to physically sourcing certified sustainable and traceable palm oil has helped reduce reputational risk to a degree, but we recognise that this is not enough. 

Regulatory risks: Currently we are not required to use a certified sustainable palm oil, but we need to consider sourcing impacts should this become legislated. A recent change in South African food legislation around labelling has meant that we now need to declare the type of oil used in the ingredients panel of food products. This encourages transparency, but does lead to further reputational risk as consumers become more aware of palm oil in their products.",No risk,"There is currently no legislation in place that affects our ability to continue sourcing palm oil, only legislation around packaging labelling that has increased transparency as to which products contain palm oil.",Material risk,"With increasing media coverage, NGO and activist campaigns, business exposes, social media campaigns and consumer pressure around palm oil and deforestation, there are huge reputational risks for our business. As a leading sustainable retailer, we have already received a lot of criticism on our use of unsustainable palm oil and are expected to lead on this issue and set an example for other retailers in South Africa. We are reliant on being able to gain access to a supply of certified sustainable palm oil as well as the credibility of the sustainability standards and certification bodies that we work with, and their support from NGOs, activists and consumers.",Material risk,"Whilst we are not major users of palm oil, we rely on palm oil, due to its unique qualities, we are reliant on palm oil for a wide range of foods and non-foods products. We have identified that palm oil is difficult to substitute, and possible alternatives come with their own sustainability challenges (e.g GM). Therefore an inability to source sufficient quantities of palm oil would undermine our product development and offering, and competitiveness."
2014,Woolworths Holdings Ltd,South Africa,"(-30.559482, 22.937506)",3,Cattle Products,Yes,"Our risk assessment process evaluates the following:

Operational risks: We have assessed the level of consumption across business and have identified that we use a large volume of cattle based products in our supply chain. We do have full traceability when it comes to our food products however, which reduces this risk significantly (all beef and dairy products are sourced from farms in South Africa, Namibia and occasionally Botswana, areas where we know there is no clearing of forest land for farming). We have identified that our risk lies heavily with our leather based clothing, footwear and accessories, where we rely on large amounts of leather and do not have access to large amounts of South African leather or traceability back to point of origin. We have identified that we need to collect consumption data as a first step to being able to understand our operational risks better.

Security of supply: We have identified this as a potential risk, when it comes to leather, and have identified need to help increase the supply of South African leather, but still need to do further work to understand this risk. 

Environmental and social risks: This includes deforestation, biodiversity loss and species extinction, environmental degradation, animal welfare, land conflict and displacement, and social conditions. We have identified that we can make considerable impact in reducing these risks due to the large volume of leather we source across the business. In the area of food products, we can help farmers develop more sustainable farming practices.

Reputational risks: With increasing pressure from consumers, NGOs and activists on the issue of deforestation, we have identified that this is a risk to our business.
