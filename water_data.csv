Sempra Energy,US8168511090,EQ0035024500001000,SRE US,Utilities,USA,"Other: Sempra Energy recognizes that the energy industry is water intensive and we place a priority on respecting local water supplies and mitigating the risks associated with operating in areas where there is the potential for prolonged water scarcity.   Energy and water are intricately connected.  Energy is used to pump water to where it is needed.  Water helps cool power plants that produce energy.  Although Sempra does not have a specific company-wide water policy, strategy or management plan, we do have a company-wide environmental policy, in addition to policies at the business unit level that promote responsible stewardship of the Earth's natural resources, including water. Our environmental policy outlines performance measures, activities, and opportunities for stewardship in order to meet our goal of protecting the environment and ensuring the health and safety of our employees, our customers, and the communities where we operate. Our utilities SDG&E and SoCalGas have environmental excellence policies that describe their commitment to reducing freshwater consumption and preserving water quality through the design and operation of facilities in addition to water management plans that detail priorities for reduction. Therefore, water use is considered in all areas of our business, including electricity generation and procurement, construction projects, and natural gas operations. In general, Sempra Energy is focused on a low-carbon model with four key elements: clean natural gas, energy efficiency, renewable power, and innovation. While we encourage our customers to reduce their environmental impact by improving energy efficiency, we also look closely at our own operations and facilities to decrease energy and water usage. Electricity generation, in particular, can require a lot of water. This is a critical issue for us since our business units own and operate power-generation assets in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where water resources are limited. When water is needed for power generation, the permitting of our power plants and those of our suppliers requires securing a long-term supply and completing an impact mitigation plan. In addition, our power generation facilities were designed to minimize water use- so many are air-cooled or use recycled water. We also work with water agencies and communities where our facilities are located.  We collaborate on regional water management initiatives and comply with all mandatory and voluntary conservation requests. As water-related issues continue to grow in importance, we are considering the development of a water policy or strategy at the Company level that will formalize the strategies already in place."
